## What is this project
This project is just for study and sharpening React skills. It was created using Vite, an option for the combo webpack/babel.
```
$ npm create vite@latest
```

It's a social media website, where you can create a post and comments and like comments. There's no backend connection so everything is mocked when you start the app.
